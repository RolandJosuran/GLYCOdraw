# GLYCOdraw
GLYCOdraw is a JavaScript library to draw glycan structures. Complex carbohydrates (glycans) are ubiquitous biological molecules in living organisms. They are involved in protein interactions, immunoreactions and molecular signaling pathways. Furthermore, protein glycosylation plays a critical role in human diseases and efficacy of bio-therapeutics.

With [GLYCOdraw](https://rolandjosuran.github.io/GLYCOdraw/), glycan structures drawing glycan structures is very easy. This simplifies the everyday work of a biochemist researching carbohydrates. GLYCOdraw is a JavaScript-only solution that uses D3.js to create SVG graphics. It can easily implemented in every website.

GLYCPdraw is very easy and intuitive to use. Just select the desired monosaccharide in the toolbar and click the glycan on the canvas to attach a monosaccharide unit. The representation of the glycan follows the symbol nomenclature for glycans (SNFG), which is defined and standardized by the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/glycans/snfg.html). GLYCOdraw has a completely automated algorithm to append the monosaccharides at their default position. To append it in an alternative linkage position, drag the monosaccharide to the desired position while appending.

Finally, the glycan structure can be downloaded as SVG-graphic by clicking on the “save” button in the toolbar.
